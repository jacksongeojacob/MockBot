### Project Description
MockBot is a playful, satirical bot included purely for comedic effect. It "answers" questions and "explains" features of this entirely useless project, providing witty, nonsensical responses to bring humor to your experience. While it won't solve any real problems, MockBot is here to make sure you at least get a laugh as you browse this project!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Lack of sarcastic motivation in our lives and unable to find joy without a dose of playful mockery.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
With people feeling bored and unmotivated without a bit of mockery, we created a bot to give them the playful teasing they crave.
